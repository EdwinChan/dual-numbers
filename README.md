This Python module implements dual numbers of the form a + bi + cj + dk + …,
where a, b, c, d, … are elements of some underlying field, typically the field
of real numbers, and i, j, k, … are dual units. The multiplication of dual
units is associative and commutative; the only multiplication rules are i² = j²
= k² = … = 0. Dual numbers satisfy the properties of a field.

## Applications

Dual numbers model the values and first derivatives of functions at a certain
point. For example, the value of the function f(p, q) and its first derivatives
can be combined into a single dual number as

x = f + (∂f/∂p) i + (∂f/∂q) j

We can do the same for the function g(p, q):

y = g + (∂g/∂p) i + (∂g/∂q) j

The product xy of the two dual numbers contains information about fg and its
first derivatives:

xy  
= fg + [f (∂g/∂p) + g (∂f/∂p)] i + [f (∂g/∂q) + g (∂f/∂q)] j + [(∂f/∂p) (∂g/∂q) + (∂f/∂q) (∂g/∂p)] ij  
= fg + [∂(fg)/∂p] i + [∂(fg)/∂q] j + [(∂f/∂p) (∂g/∂q) + (∂f/∂q) (∂g/∂p)] ij

In addition to functions and first derivatives, dual numbers can also represent
measurements with uncertainties because uncertainties, like derivatives, are
first-order corrections. Each dual unit signifies one source of uncertainty;
for example, the dual number a + bi + cj denotes a measurement with two
distinct sources of uncertainty. The commutative nature of multiplication
reflects the fact that the uncertainty associated with the product of two
measurements is independent of the order in which the two measurements are
multiplied together.

## Properties

Any elementary function on dual numbers can be defined in terms of the
power-series expansion of the same function on the underlying field.

A function on dual numbers is undefined at the dual number a + … if the
derivative of the same function on the underlying field is undefined at a.

## Implementation

Dual units can be encoded in binary as i ↦ `0x1`, j ↦ `0x2`, k ↦ `0x4`, and so
on. Products are encoded as ij ↦ `0x1 | 0x2` = `0x3`. The product of two dual
units encoded as `i` and `j` has the encoding `0 if i & j else i | j`. If we
construct the multiplication table of dual units, with dual units arranged
along the top and left edges of the table in ascending order of their
encodings, and we color in the cells with nonzero products, the result is the
Sierpinski triangle.

## Examples

The dual numbers x = 1 + 2i and y = 3 + 4j are created by

```python
>>> from dual import Dual
>>> x = Dual.new(1, 2)
>>> y = Dual.new(3, 4)
>>> x
Dual(1, {1: 2})
>>> y
Dual(3, {2: 4})
```

Notice that we used `Dual.new()` instead of the `Dual` constructor.
`Dual.new()` generates a new dual unit every time it is called, so the dual
numbers it returns have distinct dual units; that is to say, we have y = 3 + 4j
instead of y = 3 + 4i.

The `Dual` constructor allows us to specify the dual units explicitly. The
second argument to the constructor is a `dict` whose keys are binary-encoded
dual units and whose values are the corresponding coefficients. The constructor
is needed if we want to reuse a dual unit, as in z = 5 + 6i:

```python
>>> z = Dual(5, {1: 6})
>>> z
Dual(5, {1: 6})
```

We can perform arithmetic operations on dual numbers:

```python
>>> x**2
Dual(1, {1: 4})
>>> y**2
Dual(9, {2: 24})
>>> x*y
Dual(3, {1: 6, 2: 4, 3: 8})
```

This tells us that x² = 1 + 4i, y² = 9 + 24j, and xy = 3 + 6i + 4j + 8ij.

## Numerical issues

Catastrophic cancellation can occur when computing certain expressions in
floating-point numbers. The error is most pronounced with coefficients of
products of many dual units.
